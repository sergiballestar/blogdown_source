abstract = "miRNAs are non-coding RNA sequences of 19-25nt, in many cases conserved across species, which have an important role in gene regulation. In contrast to the large number of computational tools, there is not yet an ontology that is able  to represent all concepts related to miRNA. The objective of this project is to extend an ontology about miRNA (and its targets) for the modeling and study of  concepts about miRNAs. In addition, another goal is to obtain a computational platform that allows making queries to the extended ontology."
