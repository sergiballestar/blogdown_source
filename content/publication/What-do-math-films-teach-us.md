abstract = "The results of an educational research carried out in an institute in Barcelona by secondary school students are exposed around the definition of the profile of the mathematical professional based on the viewing of different films. The students designed and answered a questionnaire elaborated around the stereotype of the character created in a videogame. Comparisons were established between what was thought and what was reflected in the films, as well as the difference between a person dedicated to mathematics and what was projected in them."
