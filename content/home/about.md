# Biography

I am a Research Assistant at [Agency for Health Quality and Assessment of Catalonia (AQuAS)](http://aquas.gencat.cat/en/sobre_aquas/). My actual fellowship was awarded by [Consorcio Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red (CIBER)](http://www.ciberisciii.es/en). I am interested in Health Research & Data Analysis, in order to use this knowledge for Health Quality and Assesment which can help us taking better decisions. I enjoy working in a collaborative environment with people from diverse backgrounds, with an aim to enhance knowledge and understanding of the real world data.

In addition to research, I am passionate about education. I've been involved in diferent scientific youth educational projects, such as the Youth Science Fair [Exporecerca Jove](https://magmarecerca.org/Magma/lang/eng/index.php), science workshops for primary and secondary schools done by [Funbrain](http://funbrain.cat/es/) or school reinforcement programs such as [Programa Exit](https://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&sl=ca&tl=en&u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.edubcn.cat%2Fexit%2F)
